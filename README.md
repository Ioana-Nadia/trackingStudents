# trackingStudents
  This project was created in 2018. I worked on it with some of my high school classmates and our teacher. We needed it to cover the database part.
 
  It is an application that contains various operations on the database to serve the educational units. 

  In Romania there are different criteria for students who want to take the entrance exam, then universities need a student data management system.

  For example, we need to know what the list of students looks like in descending order by grades to know who receives the scholarship. Another example would be to know which students are from other cities, to know who needs a place in the dormitory.
  
  The data of students must be entered into a file, then the table that contains them will be created. The application has a panel that contains several buttons. Each button executes a command that displays information from the database according to a predefined rule

By clicking on a button, the information requested by the user appears on the panel.
